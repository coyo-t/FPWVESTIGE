Tal was never really into the killing and beheading for a god that her contemporaries were. 
Neither was she very good at speaking, though the rest of her kind wasn't either, she was especially bad at it.
Far from stupid, just especially bad at memorising anything she grew bored of, as well as frequently aloof and oblivious.

Fortunately, so were animals. Animals understood her better than her own people did. She related best to the maned wolf.
They both had a lot in common, most obviously their excessive limbs and rusted colours.

However, animals didnt understand family, or how their kinds came to be. Tal did though.
She realised many animals seemed to be the same or close. A jackal to a coyote, a serval to a caracal, crows and ravens, cobras and vipers, and any number of fish.
They all seem to improve to what they needed or avoided.
In much the same way a family tree could be made for her lineage, she began mapping trees for the animals.
The tree was in her head, and in her dreams. The dreams felt very real though, as if it were a real tree, sometimes unable to descern what was
and wasnt real. Sometimes what she thought was real became so though. Tal never noticed this though.

The real trees though, she hated the real trees.
She thought the plants were silent and slow devils. They caught you when you were alone. Always around, always watching.
Their vines and roots waiting to infest your blood and consume it.
She tried to always be with at least one critter when around the plants.
"Plants can burn, evil".
"Plants devour lone people".

The goblin people put Tal forth as their representitive for the Dungeon, not so much because they belived in her, but moreso wanted to see
how badly she'd fail, as entertainment. *Then* they would put their best foot forward.
Tal didn't quite pick up on this. Also probably didnt help that they nominated the girl who could reverse cuts and bruises from a short lapse in
waking, and could hit people far before they ever reached her.
