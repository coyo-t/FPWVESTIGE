with the "quaint bridges over brooks" and the weirdass friendly-ish green colour correction
cuz "this was made from nature" i guess?
and for some reason bags of coffee are just sitting on rocks
well that was the basis of it
and then it restarted
and instead of each bag having its name or whatever over it?
it just had fucking [C]
like, same scale no matter how far away
like a sprite drawn over everything else
and sometimes [C] would just appear in the centre of the screen
white with black outline fuckin arial lookin nonsense
