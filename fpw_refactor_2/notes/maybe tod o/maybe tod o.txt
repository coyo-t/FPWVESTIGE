////take all of the room begin shit and move it into room creation code
hacky yes, cleaner also yes
well cleaner in the sense that it wont run a bunch when paused/unpaused
oh yeah make it so that only some rooms can be paused
srsly make a "room properties" object >.>

im wondering if the trueend for fpw should be stvg related, tam miana out of context end of time thing, or smth relating to me being done with fnaf finally

--[[counter LWO

counter {
	count,
	min,

spooky stats screen happenings, ie ekka popping up or smth with halucinations.

reminder: make all main gameplay assets a part of one texgroup in final build
dumpass

title screen:
have the characters being swept across like in Mk4 (add blend mode?)
have rotating cubemap with earth, the moon, and the labyrinth in the bg (and the sun duh). (also make stars appear away from the sun dunkass)
selection elements horizontally centred like Mk4
"""copyright""" info should be in a separate credits menu button
cubemap rotates depending on whiich menu option is selected
menu elements rendered onto 3d planes which also rotate, rather than slide. use multiple views/cameras?
maybe not views. just render to specific surfaces i think

trueend with parameter_string()
